# Recursion Level 1
The repository is meant for first level of recursive problems like: 
1. Euclid's algorithm for gcd of two numbers num1 and num2
2. Factorial of a nunber num
3. A number num1 raised to power another number num2
4. First num terms of Fibonacci sequence.

You are expected to create four functions for these problems in a single cpp file.

Also create four different functions in the same file, which use iterative approach 
to solve these problems.



Be a little careful while naming variables and functions.
